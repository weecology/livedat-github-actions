# livedat with GitHub Actions

This is a **Template Repo** designed to assist in setting up a repository for regularly-updated data 
(new data are regularly added and need cleaning and curating) **using GitHub Actions** for continuous integration. This was forked from the original [Template Repo](https://github.com/weecology/livedat) **using Travis CI** for continuous integration at version 0.11.2. Read [our PLOS Biology paper](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.3000125) for more details.

Instructions for creating an updating data workflow can be found at our companion website: 
## [UpdatingData.org/githubactions](https://www.updatingdata.org/githubactions/).

  The basic steps are:

    1. Clone the repository
    2. Configure the repository for your project
    3. Connect to Zenodo
    4. Connect to Travis
    5. Allow automated updating
    6. Add data code
    7. Add data
    8. Add data checks
    9. Update data
